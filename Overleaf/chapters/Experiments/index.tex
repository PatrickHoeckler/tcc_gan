\chapter{Experiments} \label{cha:experiments}
This chapter describes the results of the experiments made and contains some remarks about them, the full conclusions will be presented later in \autoref{cha:conclusion}. All generated images shown in this chapter are not cherry-picked and will always refer to the generator which produced the lowest \gls{FCD} metric unless noted otherwise.

When calculating the \gls{CS} and \gls{FCD} metrics, the number of samples used was $200\times256 = 51,200$ for evaluating generators training with the \gls{MNIST} and Fashion MNIST datasets, for the \gls{CIFAR}-10 dataset this number was cut in half to $25,600$ due to memory constraints in the machine available (see Apendix \ref{apd:machine_specs} for specifications).

For all the \acp{GAN} that use a discriminator instead of a critic (i.e. \gls{GAN}, \gls{DCGAN} and \gls{CGAN}), the loss for the generator was not the one that minimizes the chance of the discriminator being right $\log(1 - D(G(\bm{z})))$, but the one that maximizes the chances of it being wrong $\log(D(G(\bm{z})))$. As discussed in \autoref{sec:gan_architecture}, this idea existed since the introduction of \acp{GAN} \cite{gans2014} and is empirically motivated by the fact that it produces more reliable gradients when the generator has not yet learned to create good results.

The following abbreviations will be used to refer to the values of the hyperparameters used in the experiments: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \gls{BS}
    \item \glsreset{BN}\gls{BN} \textbf{--} \texttt{Yes} if used in any manner; \texttt{No} otherwise
    \item \gls{UP} \textbf{--} \texttt{TrpConv} for transposed convolutions; \texttt{Bilinear} for bilinear upsampling; \texttt{Nearest} for Nearest Neighbour upsampling.
    \item \gls{OPT}
    \item \gls{LDIM}
    \item \gls{CLIP}
    \item \gls{NCRIT}
    \item \gls{SMOOTH} \textbf{--} If not present, then no label smoothing was used
    \item Momentum hyperparameter of Adam (\gls{beta_1})
    \item Learning rate (\gls{learning_rate})
\end{itemize}
